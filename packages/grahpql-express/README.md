# GRAPHQL example

This example demonstrates how you can create tests on an [Grahpql](https://graphql.org/) API using Mocha.js. 
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. Express is used to create a server and supertest is used for HTTP assertions inside the Mocha test runner. 

## Commands
- No config file is needed for Mocha as the app uses default values
- `npm test` - run the mocha test code
